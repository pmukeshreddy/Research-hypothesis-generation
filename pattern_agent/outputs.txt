1. Strategic Research Directions
These are high-level, synthesized insights from generate_enhanced_insights() that identify actionable research opportunities:

Each will have a clear title, explanation, supporting evidence, suggested research directions, and impact assessment
These represent the most valuable insights as they connect multiple patterns into coherent strategies
Example: "Integration of Optogenetics with Brain-Computer Interfaces" with explanation of why this direction is promising

2. Research Gaps
Specific areas where research is missing or underdeveloped:

Clear descriptions of each gap identified by the LLM
2-3 potential research directions to address each gap
Explanation of why each gap is significant
Impact scores for addressing each gap
Example: "Gap between hippocampus studies and memory formation in neurodegenerative conditions"

3. Interdisciplinary Connections
Opportunities for cross-field collaboration:

Which research areas could productively connect
Descriptions of potential overlaps and connections
Specific interdisciplinary research questions
Benefits of interdisciplinary approaches
Emerging fields that might result
Example: "Connecting fMRI methodologies with psychiatric condition research"

4. Concept Trend Analyses
